# PyWizardry

## About
this is an editor that was created solely for fun and to test out my python skills (they are very poorly) this is with the usage of the tkinter module

## What can you do with this editor:
- open files
- save files
- create files
- edit in a zen mode

## What to expect of changes.
- spelling checking
- project management
    - making it easier to work in projects going from file to file with the project
